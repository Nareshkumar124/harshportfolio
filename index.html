                    <p>I'm an engineer pursuing my B.Tech from Akal University, Talwandi Sabo, Bathinda, Punjab, India.
                        My
                        passion lies in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I have worked on various projects
                        in
                        these fields, including developing predictive models, creating intelligent systems, and
                        implementing
                        machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems. I enjoy solving complex problems and
                        am
                        continuously learning to stay updated with the latest advancements in AI/ML.</p>
